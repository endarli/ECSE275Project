# ECSE275 Final Project - Manufacturing Line

## Description
Use robot arms to move a box down conveyor belts to a goal point.

## Instructions to Use
1. Clone the repository: <br>
  <code>git clone git@github.com:lc-st1/ECSE275.git</code>
2. Open the RobotScene.ttt file and run it


## Robot Scene
A general setup of the project consists of two perpendicular conveyor belts, two stationary IRB140 robot arms and the end of each conveyor, a few cuboids OR a cuboid, proximity sensors that detect the box(es) and stop the conveyor, end effectors to assist robot arm movement, and a final goal point for where the cuboid will stop.
